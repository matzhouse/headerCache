This is a little proof of concept program to serve pages from memcache, similar to the nginx module that pulls pages direct from memcache.

It's written in PHP at the moment so might not be as fast as it can be.  

It is header aware - as in the cached version has header information included with it so the correct http status code can be sent with the http response.

TODO

Try compiling into hiphop to test performance.

Try writing in another language - again to test performance (possible python or scala)
